# Cloudflare Workers Internship Application: Full-Stack

## What is it?

Using Cloudflare Workers, I deployed an application that will randomly send users to one of two webpages. Then it will persist which URL is chosen as a cookie and the user will see the same page when they return. This project taught me how to write applications with the Cloudflare Workers API and the HTMLRewriter API, manage and develop them using the command-line tool Wrangler, and deploy them to the free workers.dev deployment playground.


Here is the Deployment url: https://myworker.hamilton.workers.dev/
